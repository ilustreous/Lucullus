Lucullus Project
================

Lucullus is a framework to manage and visualize scientific data in a browser.

The server is based on [bottle](http://bottle.paws.de) (python) and uses cairo to render 2d image tiles in realtime. On client-side a custom JavaScript library based on jQuery and ExtJS allows easy navigation through huge amounts of data with a google-maps-like interface.

Plugins exist to manage, edit and visualize:

*   Sequence alignments (Fasta format)
*   Phylogenetic trees as exported by ClustalW or PHYLIB (Newick *.phb format)
